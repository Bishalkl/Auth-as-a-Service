# Auth-as-a-Service
 üîê Auth-as-a-Service project 


To create a full Auth-as-a-Service project, you will need to implement a set of features that provide users with secure authentication and authorization capabilities. Here's a comprehensive recap of the core features you should implement for your Auth-as-a-Service project:
1. User Registration

    Endpoint: POST /register

    Functionality:

        Allow users to register with a username, email, and password.

        Password hashing to store passwords securely.

        Email verification: Send a verification email with a unique verification token to confirm the user's email address.

        Save the user: Store the user‚Äôs data in the database with a IsVerified flag set to false initially.

2. User Login

    Endpoint: POST /login

    Functionality:

        Authenticate users by their username or email and password.

        Compare the provided password with the stored hashed password.

        If valid, generate and return a JWT token.

        Check if the email is verified (IsVerified = true) before allowing login.

3. Email Verification

    Endpoint: GET /verify-email?token=

    Functionality:

        Allow users to verify their email using the unique verification token they receive via email after registration.

        Once verified, set the IsVerified flag to true in the database.

4. OAuth Integration

    OAuth Providers: Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.

    Functionality:

        Allow users to log in using third-party authentication providers via OAuth 2.0.

        Implement the OAuth login flow (redirecting to OAuth provider and exchanging tokens for user information).

        Check if the user already exists in the database, if not, create a new user.

        Generate and return a JWT token for authenticated users.

5. Password Reset (Forgot Password)

    Endpoints:

        POST /forgot-password: Request a password reset link.

        POST /reset-password?token=: Reset the password with a reset token.

    Functionality:

        Forgot Password: Send a password reset link to the user's email.

        Password Reset: Allow users to reset their password by providing a new one, using the reset token for verification.

        The reset token should expire after a certain period for security.

6. Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

    Functionality:

        Implement different user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest) to control access to certain routes or features.

        Assign roles to users during registration or via an admin interface.

        Protect routes based on user roles, e.g., only admins can access certain endpoints.

7. JWT Authentication

    Functionality:

        Secure the routes by requiring users to send a JWT token in the request headers (Authorization: Bearer <token>).

        Implement token expiration and refresh tokens for long-lived sessions.

        Implement a token blacklist or revocation list if needed (for logging out or invalidating tokens).

8. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

    Functionality (optional, but adds an extra layer of security):

        After successful login, prompt the user to provide a second factor (e.g., via SMS or an authenticator app).

        Use libraries like Google Authenticator or TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for generating 2FA codes.

9. Account Lockout & Rate Limiting

    Functionality (optional, for added security):

        Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

        Add rate limiting on sensitive endpoints like login or password reset to prevent abuse.

10. Logging Out

    Endpoint: POST /logout

    Functionality:

        Invalidate the JWT token.

        Optionally, maintain a token blacklist for sessions that should be manually invalidated.

11. Admin Dashboard/Management (Optional)

    Functionality (optional, for managing users):

        Admin can manage users, roles, and their statuses (e.g., activate/deactivate users, change roles).

        This is especially useful for services with different user levels and admin permissions.

12. Email and Notification System

    Functionality:

        Implement email services to send registration, password reset, email verification, and other notifications.

        Use libraries like SendGrid or SMTP for sending emails.

Recap of Core Features:

    User Registration with email verification.

    User Login with JWT tokens.

    OAuth Integration (Google, Facebook, etc.).

    Forgot Password and Reset Password.

    Role-based Access Control (RBAC).

    JWT Authentication and Token Expiration/Refresh.

    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (optional).

    Account Lockout & Rate Limiting (optional).

    Admin Dashboard for managing users (optional).

    Email/Notification System.

Flow of the Application:

    User registers with username/email/password, receives a verification email.

    User verifies email using the link.

    User logs in using credentials or OAuth.

    JWT token is returned for authenticated requests.

    If the user forgets their password, they can request a password reset link via email.

    Admins can manage user roles and permissions.



ou're off to a solid start, Bishal! These models are well-designed and follow good practices. To turn your project into a professional-grade Auth-as-a-Service, here‚Äôs a checklist of what you have ‚úÖ and what you might still need üîß.
‚úÖ What You Already Have (Great Work!)

    User model

        Secure fields (PasswordHash)

        Email + username uniqueness

        IsVerified flag

    UserRole model

        Role-based structure for RBAC

    RefreshToken model

        Stores refresh token with UserAgent, IPAddress, and ExpiresAt

üõ†Ô∏è What You Might Still Need
1. Email Verification Flow

    Add a verification_token column (optional, or store in Redis)

    Create /verify-email?token= endpoint

    Send email on registration

2. Refresh Token Flow

    /refresh-token endpoint to exchange a valid refresh token for a new JWT

    Invalidate old refresh tokens on logout or refresh (optional: use rotation strategy)

3. Forgot & Reset Password

    Table/Redis to store one-time reset tokens

    Endpoints: /forgot-password, /reset-password

    Send secure reset link via email

4. Logout Endpoint

    Invalidate or delete refresh token (e.g., /logout)

    Optionally log logout device info

5. OAuth Login (Optional)

    Google/GitHub sign-in via oauth2 package

    Store external provider info (e.g., provider, provider_id)

6. Security Best Practices

    Add DeviceInfo in RefreshToken model if needed

    Rate-limiting or IP throttling

    httpOnly, Secure flags if using cookies

    Store refresh tokens in a secure way (hashed or Redis)

‚ú® Optional Enhancements

    Email templates with HTML

    Admin-only user management endpoints

    Audit logs (who logged in from where, when)

    MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)# Auth-as-a-Service
